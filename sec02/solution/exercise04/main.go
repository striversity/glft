/* TODO 1 - Write a complete Go program which declares the 
following identifiers as either const or var:

++ NOTE ++: Depending on the context, some of these might be 
const or var. So there isn't a single correct answer.

    pi - Used instead of the value 3.14
    secondsInHour - Used instead of the value 60
    hoursInDay - Used instead of the value 24
    presenterName - name of current presenter which may change as records are processed
    favoriteLanguage - holds your favoritate programming or written language
    itemCount - represents the number of items in a shopping cart
    totalPrice - price of all items in a shopping cart
